  ### Challenges
  - Creating an effective workflow to get MVP and deliverables completed before a set deadline
  - Developing an application that is engaging enough for a user to generate enough traffic to collect on the administrative panel
  - Designing a gameplay loop that is easy to follow as well as a visual style that is legible and non intrusive
  - Refactoring large portions of the administrative panel to utilize as little communication between the frontend and backend as possible
